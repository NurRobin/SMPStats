# Server Health Refinement

## Overview
Refined the server health collection to include critical performance metrics: TPS (Ticks Per Second) and Memory Usage. These metrics are now displayed in the Server Health GUI.

## Changes
- **HealthSnapshot**: Added `tps`, `memoryUsed`, and `memoryMax` fields.
- **ServerHealthService**: Implemented collection of TPS (using `Bukkit.getTPS()`) and Memory usage (using `Runtime`).
- **ServerHealthGui**: Added display items for TPS (color-coded) and Memory Usage (MB).

## Technical Details
- **TPS**: Uses the 1-minute average from `Bukkit.getTPS()`. Color-coded: Green (>= 18), Yellow (>= 15), Red (< 15).
- **Memory**: Displays Used / Max memory in MB.

## Hot Chunks Analysis
- **Feature**: Added "Hot Chunks" detection to identify high-load areas.
- **Metrics**: Load is calculated based on Entity count + Tile Entity count (Hoppers, Redstone).
- **Ownership**:
  - Tracks block ownership for Tile Entities (Hoppers, etc.) using `PersistentDataContainer`.
  - Identifies "Top Owner" of a chunk based on Tameable entities and owned blocks.
- **GUI**: Added `HotChunksGui` to list top 10 hot chunks with teleport functionality.
