# Changelog - Version 0.13.0

**Release Date:** 2025-11-27

## 🎯 Summary

Adds a published OpenAPI 3.1 document for the HTTP API so external tools and SDK generators can consume the contract automatically.

---

## ✨ New Features

### OpenAPI Document + Endpoint
- New `GET /openapi.json` endpoint (no auth) serves a full OpenAPI 3.1 document describing all HTTP endpoints.
- Document includes schemas for stats, moments, heatmaps (with grid size), timeline ranges, health snapshots, social pairs, and death replays.
- Documents human-readable time filters (`from`/`to`) alongside legacy parameters.

### Documentation Updates
- `docs/API.md` now references `/openapi.json`, clarifies heatmap bin fields (`x`, `z`, `gridSize`) and hotspot responses, and documents full health snapshot fields (TPS, memory, hot chunks).

---

## 🔧 Technical Notes

- OpenAPI is generated at runtime by `OpenApiDocument` and versioned using the plugin version.
- Endpoint intentionally bypasses API key auth to ease discovery by tools like Swagger UI, Insomnia, and Postman.

---

## 📖 Upgrade Notes

- No configuration or database changes required.
- API consumers can now point generators at `http://<host>:<port>/openapi.json`.
