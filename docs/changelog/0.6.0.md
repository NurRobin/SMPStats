# 0.6.0

- Finished roadmap items for social stats: nearby radius config, shared kill counters, names in `/social/top`, and DB migration for pair kill columns.
- Added server health/cost index sampler (chunks/entities/hoppers/redstone) with `/health` HTTP endpoint and configurable weights.
- Expanded timeline layer with `/timeline/range/<uuid>` deltas and `/timeline/leaderboard` (weekly/monthly style) plus range-based story export hooks.
- Introduced weekly story generator: writes JSON summaries (top players/social + recent moments) and optional webhook POST.
- Fixed health redstone counting to avoid double-counting hoppers and gated story generation based on last summary date (persistent across restarts).
- New config fields (health/story/social radius), bumped plugin/pom versions to 0.6.0, updated docs/roadmap, and kept build passing.
