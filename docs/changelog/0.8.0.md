# In-Game GUI (Chest Menu)

## Overview
This feature introduces a rich, interactive chest-menu GUI for players to view their statistics and server health directly in-game, without needing to use chat commands or the web API.

## Goals
- Provide a user-friendly interface for accessing stats.
- Visualize key metrics (Playtime, Kills, Deaths, etc.) using items.
- Show server health metrics (TPS, Entity counts) in a dedicated view.
- Lay the foundation for future GUI expansions (Leaderboards, Heatmaps).

## Definition of Done
- [x] `/sstats gui` command opens the main menu.
- [x] Main menu contains navigation to "My Stats" and "Server Health".
- [x] "My Stats" view displays:
    - Playtime (formatted)
    - Kills (Mob/Player)
    - Deaths (Count + Last Cause)
    - Blocks (Broken/Placed)
    - Distance Travelled (Per dimension)
    - Combat (Damage Dealt/Taken)
    - Items (Crafted/Consumed)
- [x] "Server Health" view displays metrics from `ServerHealthService`.
- [x] Back buttons allow navigation between menus.
- [x] Inventory clicks are handled correctly (no item stealing).
- [x] GUI is closed properly.

## Technical Details
- **GuiManager**: Handles inventory click events and manages open GUIs.
- **InventoryGui Interface**: Defines the contract for all GUI screens.
- **MainMenuGui**: The entry point.
- **PlayerStatsGui**: Displays individual player stats.
- **ServerHealthGui**: Displays server metrics.

## Future Improvements
- Add Leaderboards view.
- Add Heatmap visualization (maybe via map items?).
- Add configuration for GUI items/layout.
